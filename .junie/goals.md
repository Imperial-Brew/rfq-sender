THE PROBLEM:

Need quotes for finishing/material/hardware

have many vendors, with many contacts

have many processes, with many industry names and specs

have many customers with many internal names and specs

have many rules regarding file shares


SOLUTION in utopia:

Secure--- esp any CUI or ITAR - share all relevant files within security reuirements
accuracy--- intended process-spec to vendors with all relevant data (harness packages?)
compare_$--- 
compare_LT--- 
File prep based on 'BOM' (excract lines from an excel and grab all files with names related)
send one email to many vendors, separately, without BCC
their response autopopulates myform, including some tracing function
myform autoloads to paperless API -- including files (email/attchs)
